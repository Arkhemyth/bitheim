# Project Status

## Current Milestone
`v0.1.0 — Foundation`

## Current Objective
Completing the remaining foundational runtime capabilities for v0.1.0.

## Completed
- Initialized repository structure with `uv` package management (`src-layout`).
- Translated and integrated the Bitheim Master Plan into [`docs/plan_bitheim.md`](plan_bitheim.md).
- Created the public repository under the `Arkhemyth` organization on GitHub with SSH synchronization.
- Established and refined collaboration entrypoints and standards (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `.agents/rules/git-workflow.md`).
- Established reproducible development and quality baseline (Python 3.13, Ruff, MyPy, Pytest) and validated GitHub Actions CI workflow remotely.
- Implemented and integrated minimal executable CLI (`bitheim`) using stdlib `argparse` with `--help` and `--version` support.
- Defined architectural specification [`docs/specs/SPEC-0001-configuration-and-doctor.md`](specs/SPEC-0001-configuration-and-doctor.md).
- Implemented read-only configuration subsystem with strict schema validation and deterministic precedence (default < file < environment < CLI).
- Added `bitheim doctor` diagnostic subcommand checking Python 3.13 compatibility, configuration validity, and data directory access without side effects.
- Added comprehensive unit and functional tests across configuration loading, error conditions, and CLI diagnostics.
- Defined architectural specification [`docs/specs/SPEC-0002-container-image-foundation.md`](specs/SPEC-0002-container-image-foundation.md).
- Created multi-stage reproducible Dockerfile with pinned multi-arch base images, non-root user model, and isolated runtime virtual environment.
- Configured `.dockerignore` to ensure minimal and clean build context.
- Extended GitHub Actions CI workflow with native container smoke tests and multi-platform (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) build validation.
